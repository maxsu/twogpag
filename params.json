WHAT KNOWLEDGE DO YOU SEEK?\"\r\n\r\n\"AH. PIXEL ART.\"\r\n\r\nGrid size\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe general tile grid is 32x32 with (possible) sub tiles at 16x16.\r\nThe rationale being that the basic size of a square object (eg a chair\r\nor a character) is a 32x32 area.  All base assets are designed to work\r\nat 32x32 tiling, and it's recommended that you build yours to be so as\r\nwell.  However, for versatility tiling can happen at 16x16 resolution.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/32x32grid.png\r\n   :alt: 32x32 grid example\r\n\r\n\r\nPerspective\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe camera angle is top-down, roughly 60 degrees.\r\n\r\nRendering should be orthographic, which means there is *no*\r\nperspective... things **do not** get smaller as they move into the\r\ndistance.  If you're using perspective techniques on your props or\r\ntiles, that's wrong.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/chest_perspective.png\r\n   :alt: Chest perspective example\r\n\r\nThe following image is a 3d rendering\r\n(`source <_static/images/perspective.blend>`_)\r\ndemonstrating orthographic projection.  For examples of actual\r\nproportions, see existing body of pixel art.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/60perspective.png\r\n   :alt: 60 degree camera perspective example\r\n\r\n\r\nLighting, colors, and shading\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nRoughly a \"toon style rendering\" with medium-low levels of texturing.\r\nWe want some detail, but not so much that things are so ornate that it\r\nmight make collaboration difficult.  We don't want things to be\r\n\"noisy\" either.  But detail is good.  Texturing should have a\r\ntoon-style; this is accomplished with medium to low amounts of\r\ntexturing.  Details should be used sparsely, so make them count!\r\n\r\nShade in blocks.  Begin drawing by blocking out the object first,\r\npaying attention to its volume.  Lines should be added afterward, and\r\ngenerally only around the edges and with very important details.\r\nDetails should mostly be implied by form and color, not by outlines.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/process-scaled.png\r\n   :alt: Process of blocking in a sprite\r\n\r\nLighting should primarily come from above.  If there is any side\r\ndirectionality, it should come from the left, but not by much: keep it\r\nmostly center.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/sunpoint.gif\r\n   :alt: Lighting example\r\n\r\nAn `example scene in blender <_static/images/perspective.blend>`_ with\r\na sun light pointing in the appropriate location:\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/lighting_direction.png\r\n   :alt: Lighting blender screenshot example\r\n\r\n*Left example shows from the \"top-facing\" camera used in this style;\r\nright example shows a sideview.  Yellow \"sun\" with ray is the light\r\nsource, big orange triangle on right is the camera.*\r\n\r\nYour light to dark color ramps should *never* all have the same hue.\r\nVary the hue and saturation a bit as you go from light to dark, or\r\nyour objects will look flat.\r\n\r\nTo create shadows or lowlights, once you have the main color the shade\r\nyou want it to be move the hue (hsv selector) slightly towards the\r\nclosest purple. To create highlight color, do the same but instead of\r\npurple and shade move the hue slightly towards the closest yellow and\r\nlighten it up. Adjust as necessary until it looks \"right\".\r\n\r\nInside, things will be cooler in overall color, with slightly less\r\ncontrast.  This is doubly true for things like basements, caves and\r\nother underground areas.\r\n\r\nAll drop shadows should be done with the color #322125 at 60 percent\r\nopacity.  If it makes sense, one may also provide a combined version\r\nof two tiles, so only one layer is needed to, say, put a house on a\r\ngrass background.\r\n\r\nDithering should be used sparingly if at all.  None of the base\r\nartwork has dithering.\r\n\r\nThere's no specific palette *required* for Liberated Pixel Cup asset\r\nconformance, but it's generally best to try to match to the colors\r\nused in the base set.  So that said, here's a palette that may be\r\nuseful in producing matching assets.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/colors.png\r\n   :alt: Suggested palette\r\n\r\n\r\nOutlines\r\n--------\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/rock_outlinedemo.png\r\n   :alt: Rock outline demo\r\n\r\nOutlines should be a darker version of the current color, or a dark\r\ncolor generally, not black.  (Extreme circumstances obviously may have\r\nexceptions.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTile authoring\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nDetails are simplistic.  There are more details on the edges, and the\r\ncenter tile should be either one color or a very subtle pattern.\r\n\r\nOccasional detail tiles should be thrown in to break the monotony of\r\nhaving a single repeating tile.\r\n\r\nEdged tiles such as walls and floors should be arranged in a similar\r\nmanner as the establishing art.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/tiles_example_scene.png\r\n   :alt: An example scene using tiles from the base set\r\n\r\n*Demonstrating creating tiles that can be used to make more complex\r\npatterns.*\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacters\r\n----------\r\n\r\nCharacters should have their own color palettes so that they stand out\r\nfrom the background.  Drop shadows should follow the same rule as the\r\ntiles, #322125 at 60% opacity.\r\n\r\nCharacters are squashed, roundish, and not realistically proportioned.\r\nBases are approximately two and a half heads tall and in the same\r\nperspective as the tiles.  The base should fit in a 32x48 space and\r\nthe clothing should fit in 48x64 space.  The outlines should be black\r\nor near black, no selective outlining.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/characters_nude.png\r\n   :alt: Example of unaccessorized characters\r\n\r\nWe have provided a :ref:`character base <assets-character-base>` that\r\nyou can accessorize.  (Of course, deviating from this base is\r\nperfectly fine if it makes sense; just try to keep your work within\r\nthe style as described in this document and squashed stylization we\r\nkeep generally for characters.)\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/characters_accessorized.png\r\n   :alt: Example of unaccessorized characters\r\n\r\nIf you are making an animation sheet that has multiple perspectives,\r\nyou should generally vertically sort that sheet into rows in this\r\norder: back, left, front, right.  Having the sprites arranged this\r\nway simplfies the code side of things a little bit.\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/female_spellcast.png\r\n   :alt: Spellcasting female to demonstrate direction\r\n\r\nThese concepts can generally be expanded to monsters and other\r\ncreatures, of course accounting for different proportions of said\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n\r\nProps and other objects\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nProps should be colored so that they don't blend in with the\r\nsurrounding background tiles (vary color, brightness, and saturation\r\nto provide contrast).\r\n\r\nThere's should be a large difference in lighting between the sides and\r\nthe top of objects.  Look at these objects as example:\r\n\r\n.. image:: http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/barrel_and_bucket.png\r\n   :alt: Examples of object lighting via a barrel and a bucket\r\n\r\nProps should have shadows, or they will appear not to be part of the\r\nscene.  Shadows should follow the same transparency blending rules as\r\nmentioned in the \"lighting and shadows\" section above.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings that are important enough to be worth repeating\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n * No pure colors!\r\n * Vary the hues of your color ramps!\r\n * Highlighted areas are yellow-ish, shadowed areas are purple-ish.\r\n * Block your art out first, including shadows, before adding detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful, generalist resources\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThese articles do not directly apply to the style we are building\r\nhere, but may help people get involved:\r\n\r\nPixel Tutorials:\r\n\r\n* http://tkool.jp/fancontents/lecture/graphic/ -- It's in Japanese,\r\n  but the tutorials are thorough and the art is all you really need to\r\n  figure out what they're teaching.\r\n* http://gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/ -- Excellent for teaching the why of\r\n  pixel art, not just the how.  \"So you want to be a Pixel Artist\" is\r\n  highly recommended.\r\n* http://www.pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=11299 -- A good\r\n  general course on what pixel art is and how to start making it.\r\n* http://opengameart.org/content/les-forges-pixel-art-course -- A pixel\r\n  art course that's so good that we translated and mirrored it.\r\n  Originals in French here: http://www.lesforges.org/tag/pixel%20art\r\n* http://www.natomic.com/hosted/marks/mpat/ -- Decent set of resources,\r\n  though most important is maybe the `shading piece\r\n  <http://www.natomic.com/hosted/marks/mpat/shading.html>`_ which\r\n  describes how to avoid the dreaded \"pillow shading\" style and think\r\n  about lighting placement.\r\n\r\nTiling:\r\n\r\n* http://www.squidi.net/mapmaker/musings/m091016.php -- Describes\r\n  patterns for reusable tiling\r\n* http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/106884/Implementing-Auto-tiling-Functionality-in-a-Tile-M\r\n  -- another tiling pattern, simpler than the \"blob\" pattern above\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
