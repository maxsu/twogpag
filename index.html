<h2>
<a name="grid-size" class="anchor" href="#grid-size"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Grid size</h2>

<p>The general tile grid is 32x32 with (possible) sub tiles at 16x16.
The rationale being that the basic size of a square object (eg a chair
or a character) is a 32x32 area.  All base assets are designed to work
at 32x32 tiling, and it's recommended that you build yours to be so as
well.  However, for versatility tiling can happen at 16x16 resolution.</p>

<h2>
<a name="perspective" class="anchor" href="#perspective"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Perspective</h2>

<p>The camera angle is top-down, roughly 60 degrees.</p>

<p>Rendering should be orthographic, which means there is <em>no</em>
perspective... things <strong>do not</strong> get smaller as they move into the
distance.  If you're using perspective techniques on your props or
tiles, that's wrong.</p>

   :alt: Chest perspective example</p>

<p>The following image is a 3d rendering
(<code>source &lt;_static/images/perspective.blend&gt;</code>_)
demonstrating orthographic projection.  For examples of actual
proportions, see existing body of pixel art.</p>

<h2>
<a name="lighting-colors-and-shading" class="anchor" href="#lighting-colors-and-shading"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lighting, colors, and shading</h2>

<p>Roughly a "toon style rendering" with medium-low levels of texturing.
We want some detail, but not so much that things are so ornate that it
might make collaboration difficult.  We don't want things to be
"noisy" either.  But detail is good.  Texturing should have a
toon-style; this is accomplished with medium to low amounts of
texturing.  Details should be used sparsely, so make them count!</p>

<p>Shade in blocks.  Begin drawing by blocking out the object first,
paying attention to its volume.  Lines should be added afterward, and
generally only around the edges and with very important details.
Details should mostly be implied by form and color, not by outlines.</p>

   :alt: Process of blocking in a sprite</p>

<p>Lighting should primarily come from above.  If there is any side
directionality, it should come from the left, but not by much: keep it
mostly center.</p>

   :alt: Lighting example</p>

<p>An <code>example scene in blender &lt;_static/images/perspective.blend&gt;</code>_ with
a sun light pointing in the appropriate location:</p>

<p>.. image:: <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/lighting_direction.png">http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/lighting_direction.png</a>
   :alt: Lighting blender screenshot example</p>

<p><em>Left example shows from the "top-facing" camera used in this style;
right example shows a sideview.  Yellow "sun" with ray is the light
source, big orange triangle on right is the camera.</em></p>

<p>Your light to dark color ramps should <em>never</em> all have the same hue.
Vary the hue and saturation a bit as you go from light to dark, or
your objects will look flat.</p>

<p>To create shadows or lowlights, once you have the main color the shade
you want it to be move the hue (hsv selector) slightly towards the
closest purple. To create highlight color, do the same but instead of
purple and shade move the hue slightly towards the closest yellow and
lighten it up. Adjust as necessary until it looks "right".</p>

<p>Inside, things will be cooler in overall color, with slightly less
contrast.  This is doubly true for things like basements, caves and
other underground areas.</p>

<p>All drop shadows should be done with the color #322125 at 60 percent
opacity.  If it makes sense, one may also provide a combined version
of two tiles, so only one layer is needed to, say, put a house on a
grass background.</p>

<p>Dithering should be used sparingly if at all.  None of the base
artwork has dithering.</p>

<p>There's no specific palette <em>required</em> for Liberated Pixel Cup asset
conformance, but it's generally best to try to match to the colors
used in the base set.  So that said, here's a palette that may be
useful in producing matching assets.</p>

<p>.. image:: <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/colors.png">http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/colors.png</a>
   :alt: Suggested palette</p>

<h2>
<a name="outlines" class="anchor" href="#outlines"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Outlines</h2>

<p>.. image:: <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/rock_outlinedemo.png">http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/rock_outlinedemo.png</a>
   :alt: Rock outline demo</p>

<p>Outlines should be a darker version of the current color, or a dark
color generally, not black.  (Extreme circumstances obviously may have
exceptions.)</p>

<h2>
<a name="tile-authoring" class="anchor" href="#tile-authoring"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tile authoring</h2>

<p>Details are simplistic.  There are more details on the edges, and the
center tile should be either one color or a very subtle pattern.</p>

<p>Occasional detail tiles should be thrown in to break the monotony of
having a single repeating tile.</p>

<p>Edged tiles such as walls and floors should be arranged in a similar
manner as the establishing art.</p>

<p><em>Demonstrating creating tiles that can be used to make more complex
patterns.</em></p>

<h2>
<a name="characters" class="anchor" href="#characters"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Characters</h2>

<p>Characters should have their own color palettes so that they stand out
from the background.  Drop shadows should follow the same rule as the
tiles, #322125 at 60% opacity.</p>

<p>Characters are squashed, roundish, and not realistically proportioned.
Bases are approximately two and a half heads tall and in the same
perspective as the tiles.  The base should fit in a 32x48 space and
the clothing should fit in 48x64 space.  The outlines should be black
or near black, no selective outlining.</p>

<p>.. image:: <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/characters_nude.png">http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/characters_nude.png</a>
   :alt: Example of unaccessorized characters</p>

<p>We have provided a :ref:<code>character base &lt;assets-character-base&gt;</code> that
you can accessorize.  (Of course, deviating from this base is
perfectly fine if it makes sense; just try to keep your work within
the style as described in this document and squashed stylization we
keep generally for characters.)</p>

<p>.. image:: <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/characters_accessorized.png">http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/characters_accessorized.png</a>
   :alt: Example of unaccessorized characters</p>

<p>If you are making an animation sheet that has multiple perspectives,
you should generally vertically sort that sheet into rows in this
order: back, left, front, right.  Having the sprites arranged this
way simplfies the code side of things a little bit.</p>

   :alt: Spellcasting female to demonstrate direction</p>

<p>These concepts can generally be expanded to monsters and other
creatures, of course accounting for different proportions of said
characters.</p>

<h2>
<a name="props-and-other-objects" class="anchor" href="#props-and-other-objects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Props and other objects</h2>

<p>Props should be colored so that they don't blend in with the
surrounding background tiles (vary color, brightness, and saturation
to provide contrast).</p>

<p>There's should be a large difference in lighting between the sides and
the top of objects.  Look at these objects as example:</p>

<p>.. image:: <a href="http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/barrel_and_bucket.png">http://lpc.opengameart.org/static/lpc-style-guide/_images/barrel_and_bucket.png</a>
   :alt: Examples of object lighting via a barrel and a bucket</p>

<p>Props should have shadows, or they will appear not to be part of the
scene.  Shadows should follow the same transparency blending rules as
mentioned in the "lighting and shadows" section above.</p>
